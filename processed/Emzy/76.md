    Thanks, @Emzy for writing monthly reports on your respective role issues. In future compensation requests, please link directly to those comments instead of just linking to the role issue.
    
    So instead of:
    
    > - Pricenode Operator at bisq-network/roles#14
    
    it would read:
    
    > - Pricenode Operator: https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/14#issuecomment-393234591
    
    This makes it easy for stakeholders to review everything during voting.
