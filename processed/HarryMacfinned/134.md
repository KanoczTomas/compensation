    ## Roles performed
    ### Substantive reports
    - Support | https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/64#issuecomment-425481721 | (BSQ  requested = 2000)
    Evaluation is based and intended in line with : previous compensation requests, https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/24 , and other support compensation requests.
    - Reddit | https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/35#issuecomment-425469732 | (BSQ requested = 1000)
    Considering the august vote result and the following discussion (https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/115), I feel it better to simply stop with this role. I stopped thus on sept 18th. I ask 1000 BSQ for the role during the half-month.
    - Fees and connectivity monitoring | https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/10#issuecomment-425174367 | (BSQ requested = 200)

    ## Other points (BSQ requested = 0)
    - Daily Bisq offer book + F2F offer book publication on the Bisq discourse (https://bisq.community/) : included in the reddit role.
    - https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/issues/1649 : desktop issue on spreads

    - https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/1550 : issue (raised in may 2018) about duplicates BTC nodes connection
    
    ## Contributions in progress
    - I begin to write docs on the following topics (mentionned in https://docs.bisq.network/ but without link): support, staying-private.
    Opinions are welcome in order to know if/what is worth ?
    - I did work and had a proposal (2nd step) prepared for listing fees policy. (... may serve another time.)
    - I have a proposal on special nodes compensation under the arm. Aiming to increase the number of special nodes (which is stalled since months).
