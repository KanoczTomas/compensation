    ## Summary
    
    > _Specify the total amount of BSQ you are requesting, and the BSQ address that amount should be paid to:_
    
     - BSQ requested:  2400 
     - BSQ address: B19yxYCRTVaDfRfucrH6aEzeZpoVTv8Je8S
    
    This compensation request :
    - follows the https://docs.bisq.network/roles.html#compensation recommandations
    - applies the 1BSQ=1USD rule
    - takes into account the time spent for the roles
    
    ## Roles performed
    ### Substantive reports
    
    - Support | https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/64#issuecomment-434391209 | (BSQ  requested = 2000)
    Evaluation is based and intended in line with : previous compensation requests, https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/24 , and other support compensation requests.
    
    - Fees and connectivity monitoring | see the weekly reports in https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/10 | (BSQ requested = 200)
    TL;DR: there was one unique catch this month (nodes are running well).
    
    - Prices monitoring | https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/10#issuecomment-434398889 | (BSQ requested = 200)
    
    ## Other points (BSQ requested = 0)
    - Onion(s) in installation
    
    ## Contributions in progress
    - regtest environment (hopefully will be usable for v.0.9.0)
    - in addition to existing monitoring alerts, I'm seing for online daily monitoring/reporting.

    @HarryMacfinned, thanks for following the reporting formatting instructions I originally laid out at https://docs.bisq.network/roles.html#reporting. In practice, though, most of us (including myself) have been using a different, and I think more natural / readable 
    format. I've updated the doc accordingly, please have a look at https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-docs/pull/91 to see the changes.
