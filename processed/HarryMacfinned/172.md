    ## Summary
    
    > _Specify the total amount of BSQ you are requesting, and the BSQ address that amount should be paid to:_
    
     - BSQ requested:  2400 
     - BSQ address: B19yxYCRTVaDfRfucrH6aEzeZpoVTv8Je8S
    
    This compensation request :
    - follows the https://docs.bisq.network/roles.html#compensation recommandations
    - applies the 1BSQ=1USD rule
    - takes into account the time spent for the roles
    - mimicks october compensation request (for the roles)
    
    ## Roles performed
    ### Substantive reports
    
    - Support | https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/64#issuecomment-442775533 | (BSQ  requested = 2000)
    Evaluation is based and intended in line with : previous compensation requests, https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/24 , and other support compensation requests.
    - Fees and connectivity monitoring | see the weekly reports in https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/10 | (BSQ requested = 200)
    TL;DR: there was zero catch this month (nodes are running well).
    - Prices monitoring | https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/10#issuecomment-442748989 | (BSQ requested = 200)
    
    ## Other points (BSQ requested = 0)
    - Clearnet Bisq webpages monitoring -> see the slack #bisq-monitor channel: https://bisq.slack.com/messages/C81CHDYFM .(This monitoring follows a little issue with the https://markets.bisq.network/ page)
    - investigated a bit with slack replacement proposal https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/54
    
    ## Contributions in progress
    - participation to the v0.9.0 tests = WIP => I may or will ask for compensation later on
    - I'm organizing for realtime monitoring/reporting. Should be on an onion at first.
    - I'm investigating for BTC nodes monitoring/reporting.
