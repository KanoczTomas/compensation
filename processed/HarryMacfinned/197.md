    ## Summary
    
    > _Specify the total amount of BSQ you are requesting, and the BSQ address that amount should be paid to:_
    
     - BSQ requested:  2400 
     - BSQ address: B19yxYCRTVaDfRfucrH6aEzeZpoVTv8Je8S
    
    This compensation request :
    - follows the https://docs.bisq.network/roles.html#compensation recommandations
    - applies the 1BSQ=1USD rule
    - takes into account the time spent for the roles
    - is quite a copy/paste of october & november compensation requests (for the roles)
    
    ## Roles performed
    ### Substantive reports
    
    - Support | https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/64#issuecomment-450633835 | (BSQ  requested = 2000)
    Evaluation is based and intended in line with : previous compensation requests, https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/24 , and other support compensation requests.
    
    - Fees and connectivity monitoring | see the weekly reports in https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/10 | (BSQ requested = 200)
    TL;DR: there was zero catch this month (nodes are running well).
    
    - Prices monitoring | https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/10#issuecomment-450620481 | (BSQ requested = 200)
    TL;DR: There were no noticeable divergences between pricenodes this month.
    
    ## Other points (BSQ requested = 0)
    - Clearnet Bisq webpages monitoring : 0 alert this month
    
    ## Contributions in progress
    - I'll try to provide realtime monitoring/reporting in january. Should be on an onion at first.
    - I'm working on a support documentation (compilation of main support issues)
    - It's just a beginning, but I'm putting a bit the hands in the bisq java code
