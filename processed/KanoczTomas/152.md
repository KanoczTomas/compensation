    [#145](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/145) [#82](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/82) - all belong to [#101](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/101).
    
    - Documenting above process so Bisq can stay more decentralized and any new member could do refunds monthly as planned. PR [#146](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/pull/146) has been merget to the support repo. A brief 
    [readme](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/blob/master/README.md) pointing to the doc was added to the [support repo](https://github.com/bisq-network/support) and the documentation can be viewed 
    [here](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/blob/master/reimbursement-process.md).
    
    - Took a role to update batch reimbursement as soon as possible so Bisq has no more issues with long backlogs as the last one. Already worked on [#148](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/148) [#150](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/150) 
    [#151](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/151) [#152](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/152). These issue are staged and processed, will be closed automatically after batch reimbursement happens. - all belong to 
    [#147](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/147).
    
    ## Roles performed
    
    I have a gut feeling this could be a new role, but not sure. Asking for guidance on this topic. I spoke to @cbeams that I will take the role of a person who monitors the support repo and processes reimbursement claims with a target of reimbursement batches once per 
    month in mind.

    Thanks, @KanoczTomas, we actually have an existing 'Support Maintainer' role that covers this well. See my comments at https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/76#issuecomment-434836367 regarding handover to you.
