    ### January 2019
    - created and documented a helper script to process reimbursements - inspired by my laziness and a huge batch reimbursement that needed automation (commit [526f4b0...](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/commit/526f4b028f9753aa9afea12e2c5c2e9b9196eb8b)) - 
    **requesting  200  BSQ**

    To me your compensation request feels a little bit low compared to what you contributed.


@KanoczTomas commented 13 days ago:
    @ripcurlx thanks, I reconsidered the amount requesting the automation script. From the stakeholders perspective it is much more then 5 BSQ value added. I strugle to find my contribution value so thanks for the feedback. I valued it to 200 BSQ, please share your 
    thoughts if it is too much or the oposite. Also for the role I am doing for reimbursements 25 BSQ might be a bit low, but that is I thought a fixed price, maybe we should reconsider it. On the other hand adding the automation script reduces the job to do 
    significantly and 25 BSQ got realistic with that work added.
    TLDR;
    changed from 85 BSQ to 305 BSQ


@ripcurlx commented 13 days ago:
    There is no fixed value on a role. 25 BSQ is used by lots of contributors as a base value for roles you're holding and reporting when there is hardly any contribution involved in a month. So your updated amount looks now more realistic to me üëç


@KanoczTomas commented 13 days ago:
    @ripcurlx ah good to know. I had a gut feeling that the role amount is fixed :) Makes more sense now, thanks for clarifying.
