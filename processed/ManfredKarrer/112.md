    Request for dev work shipped in 0.8.0: 8000 BSQ
    
    A big part of my dev work that month was for the DAO but as it is not shipped I do not include it to that compensation request (though its mostly merged to master).
    I will consider next months to add all my past DAO work if [that proposal](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/38) gets accepted.
    
    Beside that I helped @blabno with integration of the API and started review of did some refactoring.

    - https://github.com/ManfredKarrer/bisq-core/tree/http-api
    - https://github.com/ManfredKarrer/bisq-desktop/tree/http-api
    
    As that work is not merged to master and not shipped I do not include it to that compensation request.

    @ManfredKarrer, I just noticed that you requested BSQ for the Founder role. I've been treating that role as not applicable for compensation because it doesn't directly add value, i.e. there's nothing I really do in the specific capacity of "founder" (except write a 
    monthly report). Everything I do that I request compensation for is in the context of some more specific role or in the context of an individual contribution of code, etc.
    
    If you see this differently, that's fine, but we should probably be consistent about it between us.
    
    Also, where you have "minor roles" above, do you mean "secondary roles"?
    
    Thanks.


@ManfredKarrer commented 164 days ago:
    Ah ok. Will remove that in next request...
    Re secondary role/major roles:
    I wanted to separate between those secondary roles where I had considerable effort (major) and those where not (minor).
