    ## Basic information
    
     - BSQ amount requested: **6450**
     - BSQ address: **B1N15prE63ZHC7grk2hyuVDLNfrQYCkDT84**
    
    ## Details
    
    ### Development work:
    As I was traveling I was not full time working on Bisq.
    
    A part of my dev work that month was for the DAO but as it is not shipped I do not include it to that compensation request (though its mostly merged to master). I will wait for requesting for the DAO work until it is shipped as testnet version, probably in the next 
    release mid/end October.
    
    Beside that there have been smaller not DAO related pull requests [1] which are merged to master.
    Requested BSQ: 4000 BSQ
