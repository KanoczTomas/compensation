    ## Basic information
    
     - BSQ amount requested: **10650**
     - BSQ address: **B1N15prE63ZHC7grk2hyuVDLNfrQYCkDT84**
    
    ## Details
    
    ### Development work:
    Some past dev work from previous months got shipped with 0.7.1:
    - Ack messages for all trade, offer- and dispute messages
    - Add referrer Id for external Bisq market makers
    - Fix bug with Sepa offers and Sepa instant taker
    - Fix reuse of change addresses
    - Don‚Äôt treat RBF transactions as risky
    - Fix wrong dust limit values in Bitcoinj
    - Deactivate Venmo and CashApp
    - Add popup for feedback after trade completion
    - Show popup if local Bitcoin core is running
    - Don‚Äôt include assets with diff. network type
    - Ignore ‚ÄúAlert key compromised‚Äù message from old nodes in Bitcoinj
    
    Request for past dev work shipped in 0.7.1: 8000 BSQ
    
    Most for my dev work that month was for the DAO [[1](https://github.com/ManfredKarrer/bisq-core/tree/voting)] and not shipped code so I will not include that in the compensation request.
    Beside that I did a few PRs for the Master branch but it is not shipped yet.
    Beside DAO work I helped Joachim with the Mobile notification app. Desktop integration and server is mostly complete. Iphone version is also in a pretty good state. Android app needs a bit more dev effort and will be probably completed when Joachim is back from 
    holiday. I estimate that we can launch it mid or end of August.
    Added a few new proposals as well.
    Request for dev work: 0 BSQ (nothing is shipped)
    
    ### Maintainer:
    - Maintain 6 seed nodes, 2 Bitcoin nodes, 2 price nodes, monitor node, market server and BSQ explorer (13 * 50 BSQ = 650 BSQ)
    
    Requested as nodes maintainer: 650 BSQ

    @ManfredKarrer Maybe for next time you could directly link to the report comments, so it is quicker to go through your reports (e.g. https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/1#issuecomment-408156846) üòÑ
