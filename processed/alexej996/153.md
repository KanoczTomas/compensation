    @alexej996, thanks for following the reporting formatting instructions I originally laid out at https://docs.bisq.network/roles.html#reporting. In practice, though, most of us (including myself) have been using a different, and I think more natural / readable 
    format. I've updated the doc accordingly, please have a look at https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-docs/pull/91 to see the changes.
