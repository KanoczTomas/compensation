    Great stuff, @alfsbs. Thanks for sharing the graphs and other data on the payment method maintainer issue.
    
    In future compensation requests, please link directly to the monthly report comment, instead of linking just to the issue itself. For example, this month, instead of linking like this:
    
    > - Payment Methods Maintainter bisq-network/roles#38
    
    You would have linked like this:
    
    > - Payment Methods Maintainter: https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/38#issuecomment-393504836
    
    Doing it this way just makes it easier for stakeholders to click links and go directly to what they need to review when voting.
    
    (Note that I gave the same feedback to @emzy and others, see https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/76#issuecomment-394821593))
