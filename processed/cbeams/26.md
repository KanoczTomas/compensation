    N.B. As with previous months, it is not at all ideal to combine all of these roles into a single compensation request, because it makes it difficult to judge and vote on my performance in each specific role. It is just a matter of practicality for now that we 
    combine everything into one request like this. The 14,000 BSQ figure is basically a salary-style monthly rate, and that's not ideal either. Per the Phase Zero plan, we want to move toward an environment where we're evaluating each other's work (be it in dedicated 
    roles, or in completing specific tasks and projects) in terms of what that work is worth to the Bisq project, network and user base. But we have to get there step by step, and among the first steps is growing the contributor base sufficiently to decentralize these 
    roles to the point where it becomes practical for everybody to report on and evaluate things this way. In the meantime, I think we'll have to continue dealing with compromises like this.
