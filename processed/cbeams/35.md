    ## Basic information
    
    > _Specify the amount of BSQ you are requesting, and the BSQ address that amount should be paid to:_
    
     - BSQ amount requested: 18000
     - BSQ address: B1HGxmhfWJwwvvDgTRrWpZ1QsEZn7rMEaVE
    
    ## Details
    
    > _Provide links to the work you are requesting compensation for, along with any comments or explanations that will help stakeholders understand its value._
    
    This month, a new *Support Staff* role was created (bisq-network/roles#64), which I created and took on in order to service reimbursements for failed trades due to the transaction timeout and broadcast failure bugs introduced in Bisq v0.6.2 and now fixed in v0.6.3 
    and v0.6.4. This work was critical to get right, as these were our first real incidents where funds were being lost, and these issues affected dozens of users. All reimbursements are now complete, with plenty of positive feedback from affected users, and we now have 
    a solid system and procedures in place should something like this happen again. For the extra value this work represents to Bisq, I've increased my usual 14,000 BSQ request to 18,000 this month. I intend to reduce it back to the normal level next month.
    
    The following are roles I am responsible for, with links to my monthly report about each.
