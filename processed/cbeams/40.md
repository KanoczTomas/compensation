    ## Basic information
    
    > _Specify the amount of BSQ you are requesting, and the BSQ address that amount should be paid to:_
    
     - BSQ amount requested: 8000
     - BSQ address: B1HGxmhfWJwwvvDgTRrWpZ1QsEZn7rMEaVE
    
    Note that I'm requesting 8000 this month, which is 6000 lower than the usual 14,000 I request, because much of my time this month was spent refactoring Bisq's pricenode. I'll be requesting compensation for that next month, when the work is fully finished.
    
    ## Details
    
    > _Provide links to the work you are requesting compensation for, along with any comments or explanations that will help stakeholders understand its value._
    
    The following are roles I am responsible for, with links to my monthly report about each.

    ## Todo
    
     - [x] Add a monthly report comment to each of the role issues above and then link to it here
    
    ## Notes to self
    
    The list of roles above was generated by the following  ghi  command run within my clone of this repository:
    
    ```
    ghi list --assignee=cbeams --no-labels \
    | grep -v '^#' \
    | cut -b7- | rev | cut -d' ' -f3- | rev | sort \
    | xargs -Irole echo " - role: "
    ```
    
    Also useful to opening all of these issues is the following command:
    ```
    for role in $(ghi list --mine | grep -v '^#' | cut -b-5); do ghi show --web $role; done;
    ```
