    ## Contributions delivered
    
    > _Provide links to contributions you have [delivered](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19), the amount of BSQ you are requesting for each, and any comments that will help stakeholders understand its value._
    
    The list of contributions below was produced by reviewing the results of this GitHub issues query: [org:bisq-network involves:cbeams 
    updated:2018-04-01..2018-04-30](https://github.com/issues?page=1&q=org%3Abisq-network+involves%3Acbeams+updated%3A2018-04-01..2018-04-30&utf8=%E2%9C%93).
    
    The list below does _not_ include activities that are a normal part of performing a given role. For example, I have not included conducting the [April 4th-6th voting round](https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/56), because this is a normal part of 
    performing Compensation Maintainer role duties. Likewise, I have not included the work that I did to operate the @bisq_network Twitter handle, as this is part of the Twitter Admin role.
    
    What follows, then, is work that I contributed wearing the hat of a _normal contributor,_ i.e. work that anyone could have done without any of the rights or privileges or obligations that come with owning a specific role. For example, I've listed _reviewing_ certain 
    pull requests below, because that is work that any contributor can do. But _merging_ pull requests is not included, because that is work that only _maintainers_ can do.
    
    I find it quite challenging to to assign itemized BSQ values to the items below. As I've argued in bisq-network/proposals#19, we must collectively get good at doing this, but it's going to take some practice, and it's going to take employing some good rules of thumb 
    and heuristics to get there. As I mentioned in that proposal, I think that taking the amount of time spent on a given effort multiplied by one's hourly rate can be a good starting point for these values, but that we must ultimately check that against whether the 
    amount reflects actual value added to the Bisq Network and its users. And we must find a way to do all of this without getting lost in time tracking and other non-productive overhead.
    
    This month, I'm going with a single, high-level request of 12,000 BSQ, similar to the compensation requests I've filed over the previous months, but I'm going to do what I can to submit a more itemized compensation request next month.
    
    As we grow and distribute roles more widely, it should get easier to do this. A big part of the challenge here is that we have so few people doing so many things, and that just makes things inherently hard to track and itemize. Perhaps it will remain not worth the 
    trouble in the short term, I don't know. But I believe that the more we're all able to put our heads down and focus deeply on just a few things each month, the easier it will get to submit compensation requests for that work, and the better and more intuitive a 
    sense we'll have for how much our work is worth. Let's see.

    ## Contributions in progress
    
    > _Provide links to work you're involved with that is still [in progress](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19). **This section is optional,** and is for your own benefit in keeping track of what you're doing and keeping other contributors up to date 
    with the same._
    
     - Review DAO implementation with @ManfredKarrer
     - Release bisq-desktop v0.7.0 with @ripcurlx and @ManfredKarrer
     - Produce [Getting Started with Bisq](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-docs/issues/37) doc with @m52go
     - Reviewed many new asset listing PRs for inclusion in bisq-core (now bisq-assets)
       - But these are not yet delivered as bisq-desktop v0.7.0 has not yet been released.
     - Refactored / rewrote bisq-pricenode
       - I requested 6000 fewer BSQ than usual in compensation request #40 because I hadn't finalized my pricenode refactoring (bisq-network/bisq-pricenode#7). I have finished the work, but not every pricenode operator has upgraded yet, and so I'm deferring requesting 
    compensation until that happens (which I'll take initiative on over the month to come). Basically, I don't consider this work to have been fully _delivered_ yet.
     - Bisq brand design refresh
       - With @pedromvpg, @diogorsergio, and @ripcurlx

    The following are roles where I play a _secondary_ role, and do not (necessarily) do monthly reports:
    
     - YouTube Admin: https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/56

    ## Notes to self
    <details>
    
    The list of roles above was generated by the following  ghi  command run within my clone of the bisq-network/roles repository:
    
    ```
    ghi list --assignee=cbeams --no-labels \
    | grep -v '^#' \
    | cut -b7- | rev | cut -d' ' -f3- | rev | sort \
    | xargs -Irole echo " - role: "
    ```
    
    Also useful to opening all of these issues is the following command:
    ```
    for role in $(\
    ghi list --mine \
      | grep -v '^#' \
      | cut -d'[' -f1 \
      | sed 's/^ *//' | sed 's/  /:/' \
      | awk -F':' '{print $2 ":" $1}' \
      | sort | cut -d':' -f2\
    ); do ghi show --web $role; done;
    ```
    </details>
