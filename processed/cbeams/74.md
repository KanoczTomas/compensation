    ## Notes to self
    <details>
    
    My contributions this month were created by reviewing the results of this GitHub Issues search query: [org:bisq-network involves:cbeams updated:2018-05-01..2018-05-31 
    sort:updated-desc](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=org%3Abisq-network+involves%3Acbeams+updated%3A2018-05-01..2018-05-31+sort%3Aupdated-desc+)
    
    The list of roles above was generated by the following  ghi  command run within my clone of the bisq-network/roles repository:
    
    ```
    ghi list --assignee=cbeams --no-labels \
    | grep -v '^#' \
    | cut -b7- | rev | cut -d' ' -f3- | rev | sort \
    | xargs -Irole echo " - role: "
    ```
    
    Also useful to opening all of these issues is the following command:
    ```
    for role in $(\
    ghi list --mine \
      | grep -v '^#' \
      | cut -d'[' -f1 \
      | sed 's/^ *//' | sed 's/  /:/' \
      | awk -F':' '{print $2 ":" $1}' \
      | sort | cut -d':' -f2\
    ); do ghi show --web $role; done;
    ```
    </details>
