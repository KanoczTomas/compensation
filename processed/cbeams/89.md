    ## Summary
    
    > _Specify the total amount of BSQ you are requesting, and the BSQ address that amount should be paid to:_
    
     - BSQ requested: 1760
     - BSQ address: B1HGxmhfWJwwvvDgTRrWpZ1QsEZn7rMEaVE
    
    The 1760 above is calculated as 10 for pricenode hosting, 250 for my delivered docs contributions, and 1500 for my Twitter Admin work. I've never put a specific valuation on operating the Twitter handle before, but I think that if I were not doing the work I'm doing 
    there, I would pay at least 1500 / mo to have someone do an equivalent job. I actually think I'd pay considerably more, too, as this is our most important communications channel and I think the quality of our presence there matters a lot, but I'd like to get a gauge 
    from other stakeholders about this first. Comments welcome.
    
    ## Contributions delivered
    
    > _Provide links to contributions you have [delivered](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19), the amount of BSQ you are requesting for each, and any comments that will help stakeholders understand its value._

    ### Bisq Assets
    
     - Reviewed a handful of asset PRs
     - Shipped releases [0.7.1](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-assets/releases/tag/v0.7.1) and [0.7.2](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-assets/releases/tag/v0.7.2) and integrated into Bisq Core in time for the 0.7.1 Bisq Desktop release (which will now ship 
    early next month, thus my placing these contributions here "in progress")
    
    ### Bisq Pricenode
    
     - I am still holding off on requesting any BSQ for the refactoring / rewriting of bisq-pricenode until all @bisq-network/pricenode-operators have upgraded. I asked everyone to make doing so a priority last month. I'm still not sure whether everyone has upgraded. 
    (UPDATE per https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/89#issuecomment-401546222: looks like all operators have updated, but I'll still wait until next month to claim this work).
    
    ### Lists
     - Create a bisq-announce mailing list to replace now-defunct MailChimp newsletter: https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/20
       - I need to hand this off

    The following are roles where I play a _secondary_ role, and do not (necessarily) do monthly reports:
    
     - Bisq Desktop Maintainer: bisq-network/roles#63
     - Compensation Maintainer: https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/31 (@ripcurlx took over primary ownership this month—thanks!)

    ### New roles
    
    The following are new roles that, as per my comments in my last compensation requests (#68 and #74), I have been meaning to create, but have not yet in fact done. I won't be owning these roles, just creating them (as part of the Roles Maintainer role, actually).
    
     - [x] Bisq Design Maintainer
     - [x] Bisq Assets Maintainer
     - [x] Bisq Common Maintainer
     - [x] Bisq P2P Maintainer (actually renaming existing 'P2P Developer' role)
     - [x] Bisq Core Maintainer
     - [x] Support Maintainer (for the support repo, not the 'Staff' role above)
    
    ## Notes to self
    <details>
    
    My contributions this month were created by reviewing the results of this GitHub Issues search query: [org:bisq-network involves:cbeams updated:2018-06-01..2018-06-30 
    sort:updated-desc](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=org%3Abisq-network+involves%3Acbeams+updated%3A2018-06-01..2018-06-30+sort%3Aupdated-desc+)
    
    The list of roles above was generated by the following  ghi  command run within my clone of the bisq-network/roles repository:
    
    ```
    ghi list --assignee=cbeams --no-labels \
    | grep -v '^#' \
    | cut -b7- | rev | cut -d' ' -f3- | rev | sort \
    | xargs -Irole echo " - role: "
    ```
    
    Also useful to opening all of these issues is the following command:
    ```
    for role in $(\
    ghi list --mine \
      | grep -v '^#' \
      | cut -d'[' -f1 \
      | sed 's/^ *//' | sed 's/  /:/' \
      | awk -F':' '{print $2 ":" $1}' \
      | sort | cut -d':' -f2\
    ); do ghi show --web $role; done;
    ```
    </details>
