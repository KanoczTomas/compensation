    ## Summary
    
    > _Specify the total amount of BSQ you are requesting, and the BSQ address that amount should be paid to:_
    
     - BSQ requested: 5000
     - BSQ address: B197ZcX369usMDHCF6iD2h1CMbntkovDqoe
    
    This is my first compensation request. I have talked about some of the details of the process
    with @ManfredKarrer, who I also collaborated closely with during most / all of the work. Please
    let me know if the requested BSQ amount is unreasonable, or if there's other suggestions for
    how I can file better reports in the future!
    
    ## Contributions delivered
    
    > _Provide links to contributions you have [delivered](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19), the amount of BSQ you are requesting for each, and any comments that will help stakeholders understand
     its value._
    
    I am requesting 2000 BSQ for the dev work and 3000 BSQ for the conceptual discussion and feedback.
    
    ### DAO development
    
    My development work that was shipped with the v0.8.0 release focused mainly on simplifying and hardening code and tests, as well as other engineering to improve the odds that it behaves as expected for the [DAO](https://docs.bisq.network/dao/phase-zero.html):
    
    * add and expand unit test coverage
    * simplify implementation
    * using defensive coding, verify supposed invariants
    * refactor code to be placed in more appropriate packages
    * improve comments and code style
    * remove dead code
    
    I'm listing the commits that were merged, which all were in the [bisq-core](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core) repo, below. I am aware that most contributors link to PRs instead of individual commits, but the commits themselves are better places to document 
    the work in my opinion since they persist even if we move away from github.com in the future.
    
    List of commits:
    
    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/7dcd3618 Improve wording and indentation of Price comments
    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/bd25b3c9 Change to BlockParser.isBlockAlreadyAdded() by inverting logic

    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/84c0f314 Add more checkArgument verification to OfferUtil.getAdjustedAmount()
    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/50bacfd8 Improve comments in OfferUtil
    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/e5039a29 Rename param inputValue to value in Price.parse()
    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/9e2b40b9 Add basic tests for Price.parse() and .valueOf()

    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/ad72c434 Drop unused GenesisTxParser argument from BlockParser
    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/9fd58e61 Specify random free ports for alert/wallet ports
    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/53da6b2c Make sure voteRevealInputState is initialized in ParsingModel

    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/317a0ce0 Handle all unexpected cases of bad genesis tx output sums
    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/b148592d Reorder imports of GenesisTxValidatorTest to match style guide
    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/fa677f3f Implement basic GenesisTxValidatorTest class
    * https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/commit/c08a5747 Tweak arguments passed to GenesisTxValidator.getGenesisTx()
    
    The DAO code has been shipped to users, and even though it is disabled by default I am requesting
    compensation for the code included in the v0.8.0 release, as suggested by @ManfredKarrer.
    
    ### Conceptual discussion and feedback for the DAO
    
    Beyond the pure code contributions, I have also had many discussions with @ManfredKarrer on the topic of the DAO, e.g:
    
    - testing and other reliability engineering strategies before going to mainnet
    - conceptual discussion / feedback on e.g the merit proposal, the [offchain trade protocol using bonding](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/32)
    - observations and suggestions on the high-level structure of the bisq repos and packages
    
    Most of these discussions were either offline or in private chat, so it's hard to link to
    concrete items..
    
    There's additionally various earlier suggestions for changes, reviews and so on that happened before Aug, like https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-core/pull/124, but I am not planning to list all of them.
    
    ## Roles performed
    
    > _Provide links to your [monthly report](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/13) on any roles you are responsible for._
    
    None so far.

@ManfredKarrer commented 168 days ago:
    Thanks for the request!
    
    As you mentioned I suggested to add the request already now and not to wait until the DAO code is enabled and on mainnet.
    
    I just added a proposal for discussing that topic:
    https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/38
    
    @cbeams I am sorry that we did not start the discussion earlier, too much things going on...


@HarryMacfinned commented 168 days ago:
    Thanks for helping on the dev and strengthening code.
    I'm happy to see one more dev here.
    
    One little suggestion:
    Maybe you could separate the technical report from the compensation request itself. I think it was a @cbeams advice, and I find that doubly helpful, for the writer, and for the readers.

    Thanks for the suggestion @HarryMacfinned! I will consider that next time.. for last month, there were no github issues describing the specific technical projects (general reliability engineering in preparation for the DAO, mostly) so I'm not sure where the best 
    place would be for the more technical work in this case..
