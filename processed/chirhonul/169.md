    ## Summary
    
     - BSQ requested: 1850
     - BSQ address: B197ZcX369usMDHCF6iD2h1CMbntkovDqoe
    
    ## Contributions delivered
    
    I am requesting 1400 BSQ for the operational and technical work setting up bisq.space, and another 50 BSQ for the domain name and server hosting costs. There's also a request for 400 BSQ for work on the monorepo merge some time back.
    
    ### Creating bisq.space as replacement for bisq.slack.com
    
    See comments starting at https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/54#issuecomment-440560170 for progress so far.
    
    Draft operational notes are at https://github.com/chirhonul/bisq.space and the service is usable at [bisq.space](https://bisq.space) currently, although I would be happy in requesting compensation for the work at a later time if that would be preferable.
    
    I'm requesting 1400 BSQ for the technical work setting up bisq.space, documenting and planning operational aspects, looking into operational issues etc.
    
    ### Operational costs for bisq.space
    
    See above. I'm requesting 50 BSQ for paying for the domain name and the server hosting costs.
    
    ### Assist with monorepo merge
    
    I'm requesting compensation of 400 BSQ for the historical work of assisting with the monorepo merge. This was merged to  master  but not included in the most recent v0.8.1 release as per [this 
    comment](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/38#issuecomment-425028818) saying that this is acceptable. Let me know if I misunderstood something.
