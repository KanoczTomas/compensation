    - Testing [v0.9.0 release](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v0.9.0) on Windows. This was a major release and required thorough testing. I did not find any major issues, but identified a few minor cosmetic, content, and validation issues.
    Executed the following tests in [TestQuality](https://bisq.testquality.com):
    [v0.9.0 Account Setup [Windows]](https://bisq.testquality.com/project/4883/plan/8684/run/67924/result/829110)

    - Testing the DAO on testnet. Not following any formal test cases, but performing exploratory style testing based on knowledge about the DAO I have gained from documentation and from YouTube videos. I did not find any major issues, but identified primarily usability 
    issues.

    - Resolved a few issues regarding line endings, one that was specifically causing BisqHelpFormatterTest to fail on Windows.

    https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/2032
    
    - Implemented a script that installs and configures the necessary JDK on Windows, and made a few refinements along the way. This should make the setup process for new Windows devs quick and easy, as well as ensure they are using the proper JDK.

    - Added the install_java.sh script (which had been removed as part of restructuring done in https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/1924), and updated it to work on a variety of Linux distributions. This should make the setup process for new Linux devs quick and 
    easy, as well as ensure they are using the proper JDK.

    ## Contributions in progress
    
    - Continuing to test the DAO on testnet. More exploratory style testing.
    
    - Update Windows install experience. Key features include abort the installer if the application is running prior to install or uninstall, and added German, French, and Spanish translations.
    https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/2164
    
    - Update Windows packaging process so that it is capable of performing the complete packaging
    process. This will allow anyone running Windows to easily generate their own Bisq installer if they so chose, rather than downloading it.

    - Update Linux packaging process so that it is capable of performing the complete packaging
    process. This will allow anyone running Linux to easily generate their own Bisq installer if they so chose, rather than downloading it.
    
    - Scan files using VirusTotal as part of release process in order to ensure that they are not being flagged as false positives.
