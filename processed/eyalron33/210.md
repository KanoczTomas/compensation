    @eyalron33 It would be great if you could split up your contributions in the descriptions between the different contributions, so it is easier to evaluate. Also if people do similar tasks in the future they would have a reference they could use for their valuation 
    of contribution.


@eyalron33 commented 13 days ago:
    @ripcurlx Good idea, I didn't think about it. Is it ok if I'll do it for the next time though? Because for this time I was just marking the hours for myself, without writing which task was done on each hour.
    
    Sorry about that.
    
    I added the amount of hours there for clarification.


@ripcurlx commented 13 days ago:
    I think we shouldn't add hours of work as we don't want to compensate time spent, but more work contributed. But yes, it would be great if you could split up for next month how the total sum you are requesting is made of.
