    I think that the value you added with your initiatives (kickstart day,...) is higher as what you request.
    Also I know you have done more as stated here, for instance the interview with Leigh Cuen (though as the interview is not out yet it might be added to next month).


@flix1 commented 137 days ago:
    @ManfredKarrer OK. I will increase the amount a bit. Thanks.

    @flix1 I've updated the Spreadsheet, but please don't make any changes when the voting has started next time. I've contacted the person that already had voted so far.

    Oops! My apologies @ripcurlx. It won't happen again.
