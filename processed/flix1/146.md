    @flix1 Just to be sure: Did you use a new Bisq address by intent? Before you used always `B1Pdq17bL5GiitCsNybi3Fc3V8qa7btYnPe`


@flix1 commented 106 days ago:
    @ripcurlx actually I wanted to ask about that... _B1Pdq17bL5GiitCsNybi3Fc3V8qa7btYnPe_ was my previous BSQ address. However if I hit Ctr+D now and go to the DAO section I see this new address _B18pxrZRFJ7Q1PsND9xqayk1uQbtZiH39MC_. This happened since the update to 
    v. 0.8.0.
    
    I'm hoping that my recovery seed will allow me to still have access to the old address... can you please confirm that?

    @flix1 I think atm I could just change your old address to match the new one you have access to as long as we are not on Mainnet. @ManfredKarrer Or do I miss something?


@flix1 commented 106 days ago:
    Thanks!
    Obviously once we are on Mainnet making sure to back-up everything will be as important as it is in Bitcoin.


@ManfredKarrer commented 106 days ago:
    The current address is not important and many have lost their old wallet. So i will request before mainnet anyway an new address from all... so no its just an ID.
