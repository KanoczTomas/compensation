    I just added a role for AUR maintainer.
    https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/78
    
    @freimair Is the AUR updated? In the comments it seems that there are issues...


@cbeams commented 104 days ago:
    @freimair, regarding the new role, please familiarize yourself with https://docs.bisq.network/roles.html.


@cbeams commented 103 days ago:
    It's not obvious to me that the contributions delivered are worth the requested 1000 BSQ. I'm not suggesting they aren't, just that there wasn't enough context in the description or information available via the links provided for me to judge either way.


@ripcurlx commented 103 days ago:
    Same here - I had to delegate the vote (I guess to @ManfredKarrer who is aware of all the consulting taken place), because of the lack of information.


@ripcurlx commented 103 days ago:
    Closing as complete, see https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/149#issuecomment-435645489.

    yes it seems like that, I , however, have been able to build any of the three versions without issues. I will of course have an eye out...
