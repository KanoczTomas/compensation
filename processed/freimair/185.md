    - Tor Stream isolation is available with https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/2081 (as requested by https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/731)
    - The 0.9.0 release introduced some configuration issues where I assisted in finding (https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/2048#issuecomment-444149682) and fixing them (https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/2090)
    - https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/2009: during work on the monitoring stuff a fresh release of Netlayer ([0.6.2](https://github.com/JesusMcCloud/netlayer/releases/tag/0.6.2)) was due, as there have been some hidden bugs
      - whenever only one single hidden service is active (in native tor mode), one cannot unpublish that very service
      - attempting to shut down tor within the ready-listener resulted in a deadlock (tackled by using ephemeral hidden services in native tor mode as well) (using ephemeral HS might even make some difference for https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/1943)
      - native Tor got killed by the JVM and therefore, no graceful shutdown has been possible. Now, the shutdown-hook is configurable.
    - Tor 0.3.9 (from [Torbrowser 8.0.4](https://github.com/JesusMcCloud/tor-binary/releases/tag/8.0.4-jitpack)) (via https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/2009 as well)
    - streamlined the [tor-binary](https://github.com/JesusMcCloud/tor-binary) dependency so that it builds on jitpack.io. The big advantage for Bisq is that there is no separate source repo line necessary for fetching the tor-binary dependency from (as this has lead to 
    a nasty bug https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/1917 already) (via https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/2009 as well)
    - creating and refining the [Monitoring Proposal](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/62)
    - Monitoring Release **Babysteps** (https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/62#issuecomment-450391634, https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/2181, https://monitor.bisq.network)

    - Monitoring Release **Showing Off**
    - eventually, Windows startup issues - as it has to do with Tor...
