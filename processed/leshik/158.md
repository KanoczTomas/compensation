    Hi @leshik ! Thanks for the request!
    
    As background info: 1 BSQ is considered as 1 USD (nobody knows yet the real market price so to have a consensus we estimate it to 1 USD for now). You should use the market value of your work in case you would have worked for any commercial company as orientation (no 
    discount because you like Bisq or want to support OS projects).
    
    I think your requested amount is too low. The PR was perfect without any required change. So feel free to increase it.
    
    Also feel free to get in touch on Slack, I can give you a bit more background info about the DAO, the project and open tasks. We could use more dev power like yours!

    @ManfredKarrer thanks, I increased it as you suggested. I joined Slack, will look more into it. We definitely need a great DEX (and Bisq is best for now).
