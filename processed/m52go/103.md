    Will be working with sqrrm on a Bitcoin Node maintainer doc (per [this issue](https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/66#issuecomment-407640304)) and ManfredKarrer on f2f doc (per [this 
    issue](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/pull/1607#issuecomment-408988435) and [this slack conversation](https://bisq.slack.com/archives/C701A4NNS/p1532180030000078)).
    
    After this I will consider taking on the role of mailing list maintainer [per this approved proposal](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/20), which looks like it might require proposing a new role since Mailchimp Admin is now gone. Will discuss further 
    when the time is right.
