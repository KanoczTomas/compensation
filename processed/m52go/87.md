    ## Summary
    
    > _Specify the total amount of BSQ you are requesting, and the BSQ address that amount should be paid to:_
    
     - BSQ requested: 1800
     - BSQ address: B1FGfKZQrpbLN9UNMogyJAVTR5PJNRkGPXJ
    
    ## Contributions delivered
    
    > _Provide links to contributions you have [delivered](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19), the amount of BSQ you are requesting for each, and any comments that will help stakeholders understand its value._
    
    Finished docs:
    - [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.bisq.network/getting-started.html) - 1500 BSQ
    - [Secure Your Wallet](https://docs.bisq.network/secure-wallet.html) - 300 BSQ
    
    I would imagine the Getting Started Guide was a bit of an exception in the time it took to write and the scrutiny it was put under, considering its importance in promoting & growing Bisq.
    
    Context:
    - [Here's the PR for both items](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-docs/pull/45).
    
    - [Here's the tweet thread announcing both items](https://twitter.com/bisq_network/status/1001086255277531136). Based on likes and retweets, it seems like it got above-average engagement.
    
    ## Contributions in progress
    
    > _Provide links to work you're involved with that is still [in progress](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19). **This section is optional,** and is for your own benefit in keeping track of what you're doing and keeping other contributors up to date 
    with the same._
    
    I'm working on a doc for backup & recovery, and hope to get at least one more doc done this month in addition to that. I'll also propose to take responsibility for a role...not sure which one yet.
    
    ## Roles performed
    
    > _Provide links to your [monthly report](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/13) on any roles you are responsible for._
    
    N/A.
