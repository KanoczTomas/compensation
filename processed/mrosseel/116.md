    > _Provide links to work you're involved with that is still [in progress](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19). **This section is optional,** and is for your own benefit in keeping track of what you're doing and keeping other contributors up to date

    ### Hosting
    Monthly costs nodes: 50 / node * 5: 250 BSQ
    
    Running:
    1 Price node + bitcoinaverage subscription
    1 Seed node
    2 Bitcoin full nodes
    1 Monitoring node + 1 messaging sync node (on one server)
    
    Actual costs of nodes + subscription = 162 USD, 50 USD per server average seems fair considering general maintenance and standby for issues. Consolidating sync node and monitoring node into e.g. pricenode would be possible to reduce this to 4 servers, will monitor 
    resource usage.

    @mrosseel, please review the (approved) proposal at https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/30 around how to itemize your compensation requests. As a shortcut, just look at how I and @ripcurlx did it this month at 
    https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/114 and https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/109. In particular, look at how the roles are itemized on both sides with regard to how much BSQ is being requested. Thanks.
