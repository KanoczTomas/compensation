    ### Hosting
    Monthly costs nodes: 50 / node * 5: 250 BSQ
    
    Running:
    1 Price node + bitcoinaverage subscription
    1 Seed node
    2 Bitcoin full nodes
    1 Monitoring node + 1 messaging sync node (on one server)
    
    Actual costs of nodes + subscription = 162 USD, 50 USD per server average seems fair considering general maintenance and standby for issues. Consolidating sync node and monitoring node into e.g. pricenode would be possible to reduce this to 4 servers, will monitor 
    resource usage.
