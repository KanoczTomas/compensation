    ### Hosting
    Monthly costs nodes: 50 / node * 5: 250 BSQ
    
    Running:
    1 Price node + bitcoinaverage subscription
    1 Seed node
    2 Bitcoin full nodes
    1 Monitoring node + 1 messaging sync node (on one server)
    
    Actual costs of nodes + subscription = 162 USD, 50 USD per server average seems fair considering general maintenance and standby for issues.
