    Hi @mrosseel, I just noticed this is still in draft mode and that there's no BSQ amount / address yet. I'll be filling out the voting spreadsheet between now and EOD. Could you get those values in there by then?

    hey @cbeams yes should be complete now


@cbeams commented 406 days ago:
    Thanks. This request has been entered into the [2017.12 tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xlXDswj3251BPCOcII-UyWlX7o7jMkfYBE-IZ5te5Ck/edit#gid=548599266) of the BSQ stake and voting spreadsheet and is ready to be voted on.

    @mrosseel  the role spec is missing at: https://github.com/bisq-network/roles
    Please follow "How to Create a New Role" (point 1 and 2 are already settled, follow 3,4,5).
    Thanks.


@cbeams commented 403 days ago:
    bisq-network/exchange#1103 and bisq-network/exchange#1088 have not been merged. This seems to violate the principle of requesting compensation for _completed_ work only. Perhaps I'm missing something, so I've voted `0` for this request in the meantime. Happy to 
    change my vote to `1` tomorrow morning if there is further feedback.


@mrosseel commented 402 days ago:
    Agreed for #1103 (I did a workaround to help out the api user since this route would take too long).
    For #1088 it seems this is merged in PR #1089

    Closing as complete. See bisq-network/dao#26.
