    I like the animations a lot - maybe we find a way to integrate them in the website. In the client I'll have to figure out first if I'm able to put the animations in separate threads. Are there other crypto projects using Instagram as well?
    Maybe we should think about it in more detail if and how we want to use instagram. Do we want to use it as a communication tool that gives more insights into the contributor base? Other brands sometimes have this kind of take overs, where different 
    people/contributors provide content (we could use stories format that is not stored) for a specific timeframe. I saw that we have already some engagement on it, although it doesn't drives lots of traffic to the website (web link is only possible in the profile).

    @ripcurlx instagram is fine for small actions that were done, like mile stones with added graphics. I think putting the monthly trades amount (with nice graphics) or new listings/delistings would be fine on it.

    Here are some graphics I've been working on for potential future posts.
