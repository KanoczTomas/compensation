    @pedromvpg ,
    The usual usage for compensation request is to open only one issue per month, and to group everything inside.

    @pedromvpg As @HarryMacfinned mentioned it would be great if you could merge CR of the same month into one issue next time. If the work is spread over multiple months, splitting it up is fine.

    To be honest I lack what was done in this CR, as I am fairly new could not really guess what was the work delivered - just giving feedback :)


@devinbileck commented 12 days ago:
    I agree that a more detailed description with links to GH issues would be very beneficial for those not following every single issue/PR to be able to make a decision when voting.
