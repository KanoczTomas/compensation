    Update: bisq-network/roles#71 is actually merged now, and it's fine to include it in this compensation request (please update the issue description accordingly, @rex4539). It was my bad as the Roles Maintainer that I didn't see and merge this earlier. Thanks.


@cbeams commented 258 days ago:
    Also, @rex4539, it's very interesting how you approached valuing your work here. It's clear that you valued each typo fixed at 10 BSQ (and 1 BSQ is currently valued at 1 USD during Phase Zero).
    
    For the benefit of stakeholders voting during this round, and also for the benefit of future contributors who may submit compensation requests for similar work, could you please describe your rationale for this valuation, i.e. why 10 BSQ per typo and not 5 or 15? 
    Thanks, and thanks again for the work!

    @cbeams I just thought it is a fair compensation for the work performed.
    
    Especially the typo fixes required A LOT of work, I can assure you :)
    
    But if anyone thinks it's too much, we can discuss it. I'm totally open.

    I just checked the DAO tab in the Bisq client and I still have 0 BSQ.
    
    Was my compensation request rejected?

    The BSQ is not distributed yet: See https://docs.bisq.network/dao/phase-zero.html
