    ## Summary
    
    > _Specify the amount of BSQ you are requesting, and the BSQ address that amount should be paid to:_
    
     - BSQ requested: 4295 
     - BSQ address: B1Dj1kAGDs4AGh83cPFJBQC7pDubtuZV2ZS
    
    ## Contributions delivered
    
    > _Provide links to contributions you have [delivered](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19), the amount of BSQ you are requesting for each, and any comments that will help stakeholders understand its value._
    
    The merging of all repositories is in master, which I'll add for compensation this month as it is for all developers available to use.
    
    - https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/1650
    - https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/1685
    
    **BSQ amount requested:**  840 
    
    I'll delay the compensation for the java 10 port which is also already merged into master until the 0.9.0 release, as it still needs more in-depth testing and might cause additional efforts.
    
    **Reviews of PRs**
    I'll  monitor PR reviews separately this month to separate it from the responsibilities of the Bisq Desktop Maintainer role.

    ## Contributions in progress
    
    > _Provide links to work you're involved with that is still [in progress](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19). **This section is optional,** and is for your own benefit in keeping track of what you're doing and keeping other contributors up to date 
    with the same._
    
    I'm currently working on the redesign of the Bisq client: https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/1700
    
    ## Roles performed
    
    > _Provide links to your [monthly report](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/13) on any roles you are responsible for._
    
    To make it more transparent and give people an idea how much effort which role means, I'll try to split up the overall number for each role.
