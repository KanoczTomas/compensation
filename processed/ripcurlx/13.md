    General moderation of #growthhacking channel (https://bisq.network/slack-invite).
    
    ### Analytics
    **Google Analytics:**
    Changed configuration of Google Analytics and Bisq website to be able to monitor conversion goal (Download Bisq client). This analytics will be the baseline for our first #growthhacking (https://bisq.network/slack-invite) experiments. Continuous monitoring of 
    metrics to react to certain issues.
    
    **[Reporting Spreadsheet:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o-I5fAx7DJRVqYjW8fPbo0ztlGIhIZ1EM2iLc5aEHnA/edit?usp=sharing)**
    Added daily volume chart and did some clean-ups on Google Finance live feed. Changed estimation calculation of  TV grouped by 19th to 18th  sheet and our public [Bisq Trading 
    Volume](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M8y2cIlHv5Hx5UAt4WZ961Ac8xaNSLiiavjxabNf0qc/edit?usp=sharing) so it will keep up-to-date for a whole month without manual updates.
    A full monthly reporting sheet containing our current key metrics and will follow beginning of next month.
    
    Communication and Investigation on volume number discrepancy issue with coin.dance https://github.com/bisq-network/analytics/issues/1  Should be solved soon, if coin.dance applies handling of trades data as from dan-da suggested.
