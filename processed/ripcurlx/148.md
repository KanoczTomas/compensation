    I'll again delay the compensation for the java 10 port which is also already merged into master until the 0.9.0 release, as it is still in progress and might cause additional efforts during release phase.

    I'm currently working on the redesign of the Bisq client which was merged a couple of days ago into the [release branch for 0.9.0](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/tree/release-candidate-0.9.0)

    To make it more transparent and give people an idea how much effort which role means, I'll try to split up the overall number for each role.
