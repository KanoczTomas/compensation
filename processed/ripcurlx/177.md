    **BSQ amount requested:**  1200 
    
    **Java 10 support**
    I started to support Java 9 to fix character issues in certain languages and fix other UI bugs. We ended up even supporting Java 10 and there is a PR open already for Java 11 support, which we are heading for. Unfortunately Oracle has dropped support for Java 10 and 
    is also not offering the javapackager anymore, which we used to build the different binaries. Until we find a replacement this PR is on hold.
    
    - [Remove Java 9 module configuration](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/1805)
    - [Java 10 support](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/1660)
    
    **BSQ amount requested:**  3000 
    
    **Bisq Redesign**
    It was a long and winding road to get this done with even a redesign of the redesign on the way. But I think we are all happy that we'll finally launch the new design in v0.9.0. As there is not one PR or a couple of commits (nearly every class was touched in the 
    desktop module) I could put there for you to evaluate, I can only point you to our [release branch for v0.9.0](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/tree/release-candidate-0.9.0)
    
    **BSQ amount requested:**  27000

    I'm currently in the release testing phase for our new [release 0.9.0](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/tree/release-candidate-0.9.0), which was my main focus over the last couple of months.
    
    ## Roles performed
    
    > _Provide links to your [monthly report](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/13) on any roles you are responsible for._
    
    To make it more transparent and give people an idea how much effort which role means, I'll try to split up the overall number for each role.

    After talking with @ManfredKarrer I decided also to include everything that is part of the new release on Monday in this month's compensation.
