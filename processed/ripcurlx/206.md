    ## Roles performed
    
    > _Provide links to your [monthly report](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/13) on any roles you are responsible for._
    
    To make it more transparent and give people an idea how much effort which role means, I'll try to split up the overall number for each role.

@ManfredKarrer commented 13 days ago:
    @ripcurlx Your requested amount feels too low to me.


@ripcurlx commented 13 days ago:
    @ManfredKarrer I haven't added my work on the 0.9.4 release of this month in this compensation request. But still I've also forgot to add the contributions of the last two days to the compensation request. Just updated the amount.


@ManfredKarrer commented 13 days ago:
    All what is merged can be included (even if its not released)....


@ripcurlx commented 12 days ago:
    @ManfredKarrer I know, but for me it's easier in that regard to have it in the CR when it is released, as otherwise I would need to separate merge ornot merged to master contributions as well.


@ripcurlx commented 10 days ago:
    Closing as complete, see https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/204#issuecomment-460541588.
