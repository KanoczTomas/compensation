    Added 8.100 $BSQ (20% of my previous compensation requests) as I thought the fair value of  1 $BSQ == 1 EUR  but it's actually `1 $BSQ == 1 USD`

    For the benefit of other stakeholders: regarding @ripcurlx's comment in the description above
    
    > Added 8.100 $BSQ (20% of my previous compensation requests) as I thought the fair value of  1 $BSQ == 1 EUR  but it's actually  1 $BSQ == 1 USD 
    
    I can verify that @ManfredKarrer and @ripcurlx and I discussed this matter in an (unrecorded) video chat following one of our recent live streams. This was a misunderstanding on @ripcurlx's part, and probably a failure on my part to properly communicate the change 
    made to the Phase Zero doc in https://github.com/bisq-network/dao/issues/12#issuecomment-355244745 / https://github.com/bisq-network/docs/commit/b14bea055f8ce608e5d7970a92d79dc01e2eb28f.
    
    I can also confirm that I've looked up historical USD / EUR exchange rates for the months since @ripcurlx has been submitting compensation requests and that his 20% calculation is a reasonable approximation of how much should be added here.
    
    Thanks, @ripcurlx, and sorry for the confusion!
