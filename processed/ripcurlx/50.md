    I guess I'll post in the next compensation request just the link to the merged PR's https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aripcurlx+is%3Aclosed. I'm not sure if it is of great value if I'm adding every PR no matter how small it was in 
    the end. Or maybe I just add the ones I like most üòâ
