    Everything except development efforts in April is included in this compensation request.
    
    ### Development/UX
    bisq-network/roles#63
    
    Moderation of all gui issues and #ux channel.
    
    None of my PRs this month haven't been released. Fingers crossed that we've the new release setup ready soon. The compensation of everything Development/UX related will be filed after the release of v0.7.0
    
    ### Testing
    Extended and restructured [test scenarios](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18n6wV0g5MPTs9Xni0cFji8U34xV3O1IRPDEYZrluBuU/edit#gid=1386834576) for new release v0.7.0
    
    Although the testing effort for v0.7.0 so far are documented I'll wait for compensation until the new release is out and all the test scenarios are fulfilled successfully.
