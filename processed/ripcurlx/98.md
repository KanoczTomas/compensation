    ## Contributions delivered
    
    > _Provide links to contributions you have [delivered](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19), the amount of BSQ you are requesting for each, and any comments that will help stakeholders understand its value._
    
    **Release, updates and bug fixes for v0.7.1**
    As I'm not able to separate release (is part of Bisq Desktop Maintainer role) from actual development this month, it is bundled together. The BSQ amount requested also includes the on-time setup for being able to build the release versions for each OSs (5 VMs).
    
    _PRs for this release:_
    -  https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/pull/1529
    - https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/pull/1530
    - https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/pull/1552
    - https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/pull/1553
    - https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/pull/1583
    - https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/pull/1593
    - https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/pull/1595
    
    **BSQ amount requested: 7300**
    
    **Reviews of PRs**
    I'll start to monitor this efforts separately starting next month as we had a discussion mid of this month on the responsibilities of the Bisq Desktop Maintainer role. So I only tracked my efforts for reviewing one PR separately.
    
    _Reviewed PRs:_
    - [Implements Face to Face payment method](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/pull/1607)
    
    **BSQ amount requested: 88**

    with the same._
    
    Release preparations, updates and bug fixes for v0.7.2.
    
    ## Roles performed
    
    > _Provide links to your [monthly report](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/13) on any roles you are responsible for._
    
    To make it more transparent and give people an idea how much effort which role means, I'll try to split up the overall number for each role.
