    @sqrrm, please review the (approved) proposal at https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/30 around how to itemize your compensation requests. As a shortcut, just look at how I and @ripcurlx did it this month at 
    https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/114 and https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/109. In particular, look at how the roles are itemized on both sides with regard to how much BSQ is being requested. Thanks.
