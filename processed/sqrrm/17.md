    ### Development work
    
    - Test release v0.6.0 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18n6wV0g5MPTs9Xni0cFji8U34xV3O1IRPDEYZrluBuU/edit#gid=1386834576
    - Code review of Bisq wallet and bitcoinj regarding Bip 44 implementation and bloom filter usage
    
    It's a bit hard to evaluate how much to ask for the review parts. There is a lot of time spent on review but not much to show for it apart from a silent ack that it looks ok and a minor UI bug that I didn't even fix properly 
    https://github.com/bisq-network/exchange/pull/1025. I still think it has value to have more eyes on the code, but I ask @ManfredKarrer to opine if it looks outrageous.

    @sqrrm Looks good for me. I have seen in past reviews that you actually find bugs ;-) and provide valuable improvements. If you have not found anything serious with BIP 44 I hope there are no serious issues ;-).
    Also the investigation of bloomfilters and the longest chain attack problem (B2X) is hard to estimate but I trust your time based estimation.
