    ### DAO Explorer
    I made the DAO explorer usable and setup a server to host it. It would be good to move the current explorer at explorer.bisq.network to a new server and the one I'm running at explorer.sqrrm.net seems better.

    More work on DAO related issues of more serious nature is being reviewed and more work is needed. These to PRs are about spending pending BSQ and keeping the BTC and BSQ wallet states healthy. There is also more work needed on the BSQ accounting in the dashboard 
    overview but that's more of a cosmetic issue.
