    Running 2 bitcoin nodes x 50 and one subscription to bitcoinaverage at USD12, price node run by Manfred.
    
    This month I tried moving over price node and seed node to my control but the service I used is not the most reputable (at least I would not consider them after this incident). They shut down my VPS quoting cryptocurrency mining when I was only running one seed node 
    and nothing else on that particular instance. I couldn't get an answer to why they actually shut it down but I would have to find a more solid solution to be able to take seed and price node back.

    Thanks, @sqrrm. Per https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/13, in future compensation requests, please add monthly report comments on your respective roles' issues, e.g.
    
     - Bitcoin Node Operator: https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/67
     - Pricenode Operator: https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/14
    
    And be sure to backreference your compensation requests in those comments, e.g. with a  /cc bisq-network/compensation#66  so that bi-directional links exist on both the compensation request and role issue sides.
    
    See also the more detailed comments and rationales I left about doing this on @mrosseel's and @Emzy's compensation requests:
