    Thanks, @sqrrm. Please see I just left on @Emzy's report at https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/76#issuecomment-394821593, as it applies to you too.
    
    Also, for consistency, please use  2018.05 report  headings instead of  May 2018 report . Scroll through the other recent reports in https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/14, and you'll see what I mean about this.
